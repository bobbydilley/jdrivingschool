                                was needed for a nervous learner and practiced till it was perfect‚Ä¶.no matter how it
                                took! Just overall made my driving experience a lot easier and enjoyable! Highly
                                recommend Jon to any learner!"

                                times, Jon was by far the best instructor I could have had. The lessons were so much
                                easier and I enjoyed my driving experience so much more now I was getting the right
                                support. Thanks to Jon I passed my test with only 3 minors. I believe it‚Äôs hard to find
                                the right instructor to suit your needs, but I found that Jon adapts to your needs and
                                teaches you the way that would suit you. I would highly recommend Jon as a driving
                                instructor!"

                                driving was weakest. Really nice guy, would recommend to anyone, works well around

                                personal and helped me to progress faster. He boosted my confidence by letting me get
                                behind the wheel straight away and was very patient and encouraging. I managed to pass
                                my practical driving test in just 34 hours of training with Jon."
