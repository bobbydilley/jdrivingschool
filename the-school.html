                        instructor that goes the extra mile. To be as accommodating as possible, lessons are available
                        from 8am to 8pm with door to door pickup. If you work weekdays, it’s only fair that the price of
                        evening and weekend lessons are standard and not premium pricing, as with other schools. The
                        same goes for intensive courses.

                    <p>
                        Driving School prepares pupils in only the most reliable and equipped modern vehicles. With dual
                        controls fitted to maximise safety, learners can feel confident behind the wheel as you get to
                        grips with the accelerator, clutch and brakes.

                        At present, lessons are taught in a brand new <strong>Mini Cooper S</strong> with power assisted
                        steering, a
                        manual 6 speed gearbox and all the mod-cons - definitely a car you will feel cool driving around
                        in!

                        <summary>What do I need before I start?</summary>
                        Before taking your first lesson, you must hold a provisional license. You can apply for one <a
                            href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence" target="_blank">here</a>.
                        The current fee is £50. You need to be at least 17 years of age to hold a valid provisional car
                        licence, but you can apply up to 3 months before your 17th birthday.
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How many hours will I need to learn?</summary>
                        Everyone asks this but the truth is everyone learns at different rates. As a rule of thumb, the
                        national average for a beginner with no previous experience is 40 to 50 hours. Someone with
                        prior experience might only need 20 to 30 hours. Transfer and recap pupils will be informally
                        assessed to establish competence.
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Should I take an intensive course?</summary>
                        Intensive courses are great if you are in a hurry to pass, or if you are a student with a window
                        of free time to commit to lessons. Some people would prefer to learn gradually around other
                        commitments, it completely depends on the person and their situation.
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>I'm turning 17, shall I start lessons?</summary>
                        It’s always great to hear from enthusiastic 17 or 18 year olds. There are benefits to learning
                        as soon as you can – it’s often more convenient during school than when working full-time or
                        away at university. That said, waiting until you are older, perhaps more confident, and
                        financially stable can make sense too.
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>How can I prepare for my test?</summary>
                        The first thing to say is you never have to sit your test until you are ready. Even when you
                        make a booking, you are able to postpone it providing you give enough notice. The best way you
                        can prepare is to brush up on all the manoeuvres and practise driving on test routes.
